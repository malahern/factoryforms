### About This Site

Hi! I'm Mal Ahern. This is my image database for my book-in-progress, *Factory Forms*. Here's a numbered list of things I need to do to finish the book:

1. oh
2. crap,
3. **how** 
4. will
5. i 
6. ***write***
7. this?

I'm building this site using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv), which has been pretty cool so far.

### About *Factory Forms*

Here is a compelling description of my book and why you might want to look at an image database for it.
